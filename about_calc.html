		<h3>Calculation Outline</h3>
		<p></p>
		
		<h3>Traits</h3>
		<p>The effect of traits on skill gain is very subjective. Emotional traits 
		have measurable effects on skill gain, like Creative inducing an inspired 
		mood, which boosts creative skills(1), but other traits like Art Lover 
		obviously affect which career a Sim might or should go into, but how do you 
		quantify the effect of this trait? Some traits boost the coefficient for 
		certain skills, and some provide a score increase to certain careers' final 
		score. Many traits do not affect any careers or skills needed for careers.

		<h3>Skills</h3>
		<p>A Sim's current skills were used for the base of the skill intercept. 
		</p>
		
		<h3>Likes/Dislikes (Preferences)</h3>
		<p>A Sim's preferences were used to augment the coefficient of a skill 
		(either positively or negatively).
		</p>
		
		<h3>Aspirations</h3>
		<p>Aspirations include a variety of requirements, including attaining 
		specific skill or career levels. The progression of these requirements 
		over the course of the aspiration is used to generate a linear regression, 
		which is added to the linear regression for associated skills.
