		<h3>Career Branches</h3>
		<p>The tool recommends specific career branches for most careers, however some
		careers have the same skill progression for both branches (Ex: Astronaut). For 
		these careers the branch is not specified. Aditionally, some careers do not 
		have branches.</p>
		
		<h3>University Degrees</h3>
		<p>This tool currently does not consider any university degrees a Sim may 
		have.</p>
		
		<h3>Other Traits</h3>
		<p>There are numerous bonus traits attained from satisfaction awards, choosing 
		an aspiration, high character values, completing an aspiration, etc. Only a 
		few of these traits actually affect how a Sim would perform in a career. 
		Therefore some types of traits are not availible to select when inputting Sim 
		data. For example, the character value traits from Parenthood either do not 
		affect career performance, or affect all careers equally.</p>
